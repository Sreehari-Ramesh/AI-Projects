In this project the famous Llama2 model is taken to chat with my custom datset.
The main requirements for doing this project include:

Pinecone API Key: The Pinecone vector database can store vector embeddings of documents or conversation history, allowing the chatbot to retrieve relevant responses based on the userâ€™s input.

Streamlit Replicate API Key: This is how we will apply the Llama2 model for our chatbot.

Python: The programming language we will be using to build our chatbot. (Make sure to download Python versions 3.8 or higher)
